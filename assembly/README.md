Install the heat inserts in the top and bottom panel screw locations on the frame parts. Please note you need to print one of each (Frame a,b,c,d) they are all different.
Also install the heat inserts on the top panel if you are using the AC panel.

Then install the top and bottom panels using 10-15mm screws. And the finished product should look like this.

I recommend installing some adhesive rubber feet on the bottom. To prevent it from sliding all over your table.
